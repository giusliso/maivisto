Alice in Wonderland is a 1931 black-and-white American-made film based on Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The first sound version of the story, and therefore the first film in which Carroll's original dialogue was heard, the film starred Ruth Gilbert as Alice and Leslie King as the Mad Hatter. It opened at the Warner Theatre in New York.
