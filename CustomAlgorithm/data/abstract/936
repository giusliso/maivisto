Brassed Off is a 1996 British comedy-drama film written and directed by Mark Herman and starring Pete Postlethwaite, Tara Fitzgerald and Ewan McGregor. The film, a British-American co-production made between the Monty Python production company Prominent Features, Channel Four Films and Miramax Films, is about the troubles faced by a colliery brass band, following the closure of their pit. The soundtrack for the film was provided by the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, and the plot is based on Grimethorpe's own struggles against pit closures. It is generally very positively received for its role in promoting brass bands and their music. Parts of the film make reference to the huge increase in suicides that resulted from the end of the coal industry in Britain, and the struggle to retain hope in the circumstances.Channel 4 and The Guardian both sponsored what was expected to be a low-profile film; it was not expected to gain the wide audience that it has and the film does not make explicit the political background to the plot. In Britain the film was well received as a comedy, and by some as a political statement about the state of traditional coal mining communities in the country; the American marketing for the film (and later VHS and DVD releases) portrays it as a cheerful romantic comedy with nearly no mention at all about the musical or political elements.Brassed Off was particularly well received in former mining communities, who felt it accurately reflected the suffering they faced because of the decline of their industry during the years of the Thatcher and Major Conservative governments. It is set during the latter period, when Michael Heseltine presided over a huge programme of pit closures, as President of the Board of Trade.Audio samples from the film were used on the famous 1997 Chumbawamba record, Tubthumper.
