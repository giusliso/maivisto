The Bridge on the River Kwai is a 1957 British World War II film directed by David Lean, based on the eponymous French novel (1952) by Pierre Boulle.

The movie was filmed in Ceylon (now known as Sri Lanka). The bridge in the film was located near Kitulgala.The film achieved near-universal critical acclaim, winning seven Academy Awards (including Best Picture) at the 30th Academy Awards, and in 1997 this film was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and selected for preservation in the United States Library of Congress National Film Registry. It is widely considered to be one of the greatest films of all time.
