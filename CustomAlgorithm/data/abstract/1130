A homeless woman living in Central Park is examined in this documentary. Maggie is a good-humored woman in her '40s. She lives in Central park with 6 dogs and a huge backpack. It is in the park that filmmaker Miche Negroponte met her and gradually became her friend. Outwardly she seems normal enough. She is witty, gentle, and intelligent. She claims to be the daughter of actor Robert Ryan and has six children. She also claims to receive radio reports from her husband Jupiter, the Greek god. In trying to understand what she means, Negroponte spent two years following her and interviewing her. The film, which also looks into her past is the result. ~ Sandra Brennan, Rovi
