Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (Spanish: ¡�?tame!, pronounced: [ˈa.ta.me], "Tie Me!") is a 1990 Spanish dark romantic comedy film written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar, and starring Antonio Banderas and Victoria Abril. The plot follows a recently released psychiatric patient who kidnaps an actress in order to make her fall in love with him. He believes his destiny is to marry her and father her children.The film was highly successful with both critics and audiences in Spain. Its release in the United States was entangled in controversy, instrumental in the implementation by the MPAA of a new rating category, NC-17, for films of an explicit nature that were previously unfairly regarded as pornographic because of the X rating.
