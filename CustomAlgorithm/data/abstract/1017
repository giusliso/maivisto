Trees Lounge is the 1996 feature film debut written and directed by Steve Buscemi. It was produced by Brad Wyman and Chris Hanley and features a large ensemble cast of actors, including Buscemi, Anthony LaPaglia, ChloÃ« Sevigny, and Samuel L. Jackson. The film's black humor, based on examination of characters' self-destructive behavior, has been cited as an influence by The Sopranos creator David Chase, who later hired Buscemi to direct the "Pine Barrens" episode of the show and to star as Tony Soprano's cousin Tony Blundetto during the show's fifth season.It was filmed in Glendale, Queens; Brooklyn; and Valley Stream, New York.[citation needed]
