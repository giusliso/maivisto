Beat the Devil is a 1953 film directed by John Huston. The screenplay was written by Huston and Truman Capote, loosely based upon a novel of the same name by British journalist Claud Cockburn, writing under the pseudonym James Helvick. It was intended by Huston as a parody of The Maltese Falcon (1941), also directed by Huston, and films of the same genre.The script, which was written on a day-to-day basis as the film was being shot, concerns the adventures of a motley crew of swindlers and ne'er-do-wells trying to lay claim to land rich in uranium deposits in Kenya as they wait in a small Italian port to travel aboard an ill-fated tramp steamer en route to Mombasa. The cast includes Humphrey Bogart, Jennifer Jones, Gina Lollobrigida, Robert Morley, Peter Lorre, and Bernard Lee.This movie does not easily fit into the standard set of film categories; it has variously been classified as a "thriller," a "comedy," a "drama," a "crime," and a "romance" movie. It is a parody of the Film Noir style[citation needed] that Huston himself had helped to develop.A quartet of international crooks—Peterson, O'Hara, Ross, and Ravello—are stranded in Italy while their steamer is being repaired. With them are the Dannreuthers. The six are headed for Africa, ostensibly to sell vacuum cleaners but actually to buy land supposedly loaded with uranium. They are joined by others who apparently have similar designs.
