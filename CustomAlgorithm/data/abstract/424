Children of the Corn IV: The Gathering is the fourth film in the Children of the Corn horror series. It was released in 1996, and directed by Greg Spence. The film stars Naomi Watts and Karen Black.The first in the series to go straight to video, Children of the Corn IV expands upon the origins of "He Who Walks Behind The Rows"; a deleted scene features Jane and Rosa Nock telling Grace (Naomi Watts) and Donald (Brent Jennings) how the children called the boy preacher Josiah by a different name: that of the malevolent deity of the previous films - thus revealing He Who Walks Behind The Rows to be Josiah's vengeful spirit who sought to establish the secretive mortal cults throughout the series to elevate his twisted soul to godhood through worship and sacrifice.[citation needed] It received mostly negative reception.
