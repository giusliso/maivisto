Canadian Bacon is a 1995 comedy film which satirizes Canada–United States relations along the Canada–United States border written, directed, and produced by Michael Moore. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival, and was the final released film to star John Candy, though it was shot before the earlier-released Wagons East!.
