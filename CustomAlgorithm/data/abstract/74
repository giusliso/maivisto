Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! is a 1965 exploitation film directed by Russ Meyer, who also wrote the script with Jack Moran. It stars Tura Satana, Haji, and Lori Williams.The film features gratuitous violence, sexuality, provocative gender roles, and camp dialogue. It is one of Meyer's more boldly titled and unflinchingly exploitative films; however, there is relatively little nudity.The film was shot in the extreme western parts of the Mojave Desert. However, some of the scenes appear to have been filmed farther east, near Baker, California. The last scenes in the film were made west of California City. The rail line running between Mojave and Trona, California is clearly evident.
