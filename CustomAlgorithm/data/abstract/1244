Metro is a 1997 American action-comedy/drama film which was directed by Thomas Carter, produced by Roger Birnbaum, and starring Eddie Murphy as Scott Roper, a hostage negotiator and inspector for the San Francisco Police Department who immediately seeks revenge against a psychotic jewel thief, Michael Korda (Michael Wincott), who murdered Roper's best friend, Lt. Sam Baffert (Art Evans). It was released in the United States on January 17, 1997. Metro was a commercial failure, generating over $31,987,563 during its run, and therefore did not make an effort in recovering its $55,000,000 budget. It was universally panned by critics as well.
