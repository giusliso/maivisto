Funny Face is a 1957 American musical film directed by Stanley Donen, containing assorted songs by George and Ira Gershwin. Although having the same title as the 1927 Broadway musical Funny Face by the Gershwin brothers, and featuring the same male star (Fred Astaire), the plot is totally different and only four of the songs in the stage musical are included. The screenplay was written by Leonard Gershe and in addition to Astaire it stars Audrey Hepburn and Kay Thompson. Photographer Richard Avedon designed the opening title sequence and consulted on the film; Astaire played Dick Avery, a still photographer, who is based in part on Avedon.
