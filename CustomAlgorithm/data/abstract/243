Jungle 2 Jungle is a 1997 comedy film starring Tim Allen, Martin Short and Sam Huntington. It is an American remake of the 1994 French film Un indien dans la ville (also known as Little Indian, Big City). Jungle 2 Jungle's plot follows the original film fairly closely, with the biggest difference being the change in location from Paris to New York. The film was directed by John Pasquin, and produced by Walt Disney Pictures and TF1 Films Productions.
