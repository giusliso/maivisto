Police Story 3: Super Cop (Chinese: 警察故事３超級警察; Cantonese Yale: Jing cha gu shi III: Chao ji jing cha), also known as Super Cop in North America, is a 1992 Hong Kong action film starring Jackie Chan and Michelle Yeoh. Jackie reprises his "Kevin" Chan Ka-Kui character, a Hong Kong cop from Police Story and Police Story 2. It is the first in the series not to be directed by Jackie, with Stanley Tong taking over the helm. It is also the last appearance in the series for Maggie Cheung as Jackie's girlfriend, May. Another significant aspect of this film is that it was the first Jackie Chan film from Hong Kong to use sync sound, allowing all the actors' voices to be recorded as they spoke on scene, rather than dubbed over by different actors later. The film was given a theatrical release in the United Kingdom and a VHS release, but has never been released on DVD in the United Kingdom.
