The Addiction is an unconventional 1995 American vampire film directed by Abel Ferrara, starring Lili Taylor, Edie Falco, Paul Calder√≥n, Kathryn Erbe and Christopher Walken. It was written by Ferrara's regular screenwriter, Nicholas St John, filmed in black-and-white and released simultaneously with Ferrara's period gangster film, The Funeral.The film is considered an allegory about drug addiction for some, and an allegory of the theological concept of sin by others. It contains philosophical, theological and other intellectual content, including references to Husserl, Nietzsche, Feuerbach, and Descartes. The film also features a vampire quoting the highly conservative Reformed Theologian R.C. Sproul, who is a critic of Roman Catholicism. This is ironic, considering the Catholic overtones of the films final scenes.
