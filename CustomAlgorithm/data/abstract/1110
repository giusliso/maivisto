Tank Girl is a 1995 American science fiction action film loosely based on the Tank Girl comic book created by Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett. It was directed by Rachel Talalay and stars Lori Petty as Rebecca Buck, aka the eponymous Tank Girl, who had originally appeared in the UK comic magazine Deadline. The film was met with mixed reviews from critics, and was financially unsuccessful; despite this, it gained a cult following in later years. The film's soundtrack was assembled by Hole frontwoman Courtney Love.
