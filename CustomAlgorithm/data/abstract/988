The Beautician and the Beast is a 1997 American family comedy film directed by Ken Kwapis and starring Fran Drescher and Timothy Dalton as the title characters. The story follows the misadventures of a New York City beautician who is mistakenly hired as the school teacher for the children of the president of a small Eastern European country. The story is similar to that of The King and I, The Sound of Music, and Evita, with elements also reminiscent of the sitcom The Nanny, for which Drescher is most famous.
