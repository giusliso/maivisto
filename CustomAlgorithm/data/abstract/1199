Cemetery Man (Italian title: Dellamorte Dellamore) is a 1994 comedy horror film directed by Michele Soavi. A co-production of Italy, France, and Germany, the screenplay by Gianni Romoli was based on the 1991 novel by Tiziano Sclavi. Sclavi is also the author of the comic Dylan Dog, which covers similar themes and whose protagonist is self-admittedly a Rupert Everett lookalike.[citation needed]The film stars Rupert Everett, Fran√ßois Hadji-Lazaro, and Anna Falchi. The film's story concerns the beleaguered caretaker of a small Italian cemetery, who searches for love while defending the town from zombies.
