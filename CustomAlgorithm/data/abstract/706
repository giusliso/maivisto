Bad Moon is a 1996 American horror film written and directed by Eric Red and produced by James G. Robinson. The plot involves a family man who struggles to overcome his curse. The film stars Michael Par√©, Mariel Hemingway and Mason Gamble.The film is based on the novel Thor by Wayne Smith, which mainly tells the story from the dog's viewpoint. Thor was published in the United States (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's Press hardback, Ballantine paperback), and in the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway, in German, Dutch, Swedish and Norwegian.The movie made many significant changes from the novel, particularly in the make-up of the family, which in the novel consisted of two parents and three children, as well as the dog, who sees the family as his pack, which must be defended at all costs. The dog's perceptions of events are treated in great detail, as is the relationship between him and his human family, and his confusion as to whether the werewolf is a threat to his family that must be eliminated, or a pack member who must be respected. These subtleties mainly did not make it into the film.Bad Moon received poor reviews and was a box office bomb.
