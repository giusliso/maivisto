Strictly Ballroom is a 1992 Australian romantic comedy film directed and co-written by Baz Luhrmann and produced by M&A Productions, Miramax, and Touchstone Pictures (for the direct-to-video release in North America). The film is the first installment in The Red Curtain Trilogy, Luhrmann's trilogy of theatre-motif-related films; the follow-ups were Romeo + Juliet and Moulin Rouge!. The film was based on a stage play originally developed by Luhrmann and others while he was studying at the National Institute of Dramatic Arts in Sydney in the mid-1980s, and which was later expanded for a successful season at Sydney's Wharf Theatre in 1988.
