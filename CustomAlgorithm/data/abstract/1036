Drop Dead Fred is a 1991 comedy fantasy cult film directed by Ate de Jong, produced by PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Working Title Films and released and distributed by New Line Cinema. Although promoted as a light-hearted children's film, there are notable adult themes and gags, with elements of black comedy, emotional abuse, mental illness, bizarre visual and make-up effects, gross-out humor and some profanity.Rik Mayall stars as the title character, a happy, anarchic and mischievous imaginary friend of a young girl named Elizabeth (Phoebe Cates) and arch nemesis of her overbearing mother Polly (Marsha Mason). Drop Dead Fred causes chaos around the home and neighborhood, but nobody can see Fred except Elizabeth. When Elizabeth grows up and has an emotional crisis, Fred returns to "cheer her up" in his own unique way, causing more chaos than ever before. The supporting cast includes Carrie Fisher, Ron Eldard, Tim Matheson, and Bridget Fonda.
