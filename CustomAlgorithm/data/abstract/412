A Very Brady Sequel is a 1996 comedy film and sequel to 1995’s The Brady Bunch Movie. Both films are parodies-homages of the classic 1969–1974 television sitcom The Brady Bunch. The film was directed by Arlene Sanford (in her feature film directorial debut) and stars Shelley Long and Gary Cole as Carol and Mike Brady. The film was a box office success, although not as successful as The Brady Bunch Movie. A second sequel, the made-for-television The Brady Bunch in the White House, aired in November 2002.
