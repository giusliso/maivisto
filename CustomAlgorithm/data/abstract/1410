Harlem ain't what it used to be (like most parts of today's NYC) ! Here's what it looked like in 1993.
The MG Soul Food diner was still serving its fried chicken. Public Enemy and Queen Latifah were playing at the Apollo Theather and Ralph Cooper was still the Amateur Night's MC. This bus ride goes from Amsterdam avenue, all along 125th street to Lexington and 93rd st.
This footage was shot with an old fashioned 8mm camera and grainy black and white film from the 101 bus window.
