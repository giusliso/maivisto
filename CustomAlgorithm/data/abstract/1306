Delta of Venus is a 1994 American erotic drama film—though it was released in 1995—based on the book of the same name by Anaïs Nin about an American who begins an affair with another expatriate American in pre–World War II Paris. The film was directed by Zalman King, and stars Audie England, Costas Mandylor, and Marek Vašut. NC-17 and R-rated versions of the film exist.
