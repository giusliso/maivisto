Red Rock West is a 1993 neo-noir film directed by John Dahl. It was written by Dahl and his brother Rick, and shot in Montana and Willcox, Arizona. The film was well received at the prestigious Toronto Film Festival, but deemed a cable and direct-to-video product by Columbia Tri-Star, which owned the North American rights. When Bill Banning, the owner of a San Francisco movie theater and a huge fan of the film, arranged for a theatrical release, the film gained a "buzz" and toured the U.S.[citation needed] as an art-house hit.
