As the lines between the banker's real life and the game become more uncertain, hints of a large conspiracy become apparent.The Game was well received by critics like Roger Ebert and major periodicals like The New York Times, but had middling box-office returns compared to the success of Fincher's previous film, Seven. The scene in which protagonist Van Orton finds a life-size clown doll in his driveway was ranked #44 on Bravo's list of The 100 Scariest Movie Moments.
