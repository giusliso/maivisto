Jumanji is a 1995 American fantasy adventure film about a supernatural board game that makes wild animals and other jungle hazards materialize upon each player's move. It was directed by Joe Johnston and is based on Chris Van Allsburg's popular 1981 picture book of the same name. The special effects were provided by Industrial Light & Magic in computer graphics, and Amalgamated Dynamics with animatronics.In 1969, 12-year-old Alan Parrish is trapped in Jumanji whilst playing the game with his friend Sarah. Twenty-six years later siblings Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) begin playing and unwittingly release the now-adult Alan (Robin Williams). After tracking down Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), the quartet resolve to finish the game in order to undo all its consequences. The movie also stars David Alan Grier as a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer and Jonathan Hyde in a dual role as both Alan's father and Van Pelt, a big-game hunter intent on killing Alan.Jumanji was shot in Keene, New Hampshire, where the story is set, and Vancouver, British Columbia. Despite a lukewarm critical reaction, the movie was a box office success, earning $262,797,249 worldwide from a $65m budget, and was the tenth highest-grossing movie of 1995. In 2005, a spiritual sequel to Jumanji, Zathura, which was also adapted from a Van Allsburg book, was released.
