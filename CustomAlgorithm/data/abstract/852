Inspired by a true event, this haunting drama was literally ripped from the pages of the daily newspapers by acclaimed indie director Nina Menkes, who found the story in the back pages of the Los Angeles Times. Two military police on routine patrol come upon a U.S. Marine–just back from combat in the Gulf War--digging a grave in the middle of the desert. Investigating further, they discover the bloodied corpse of the Marine’s pregnant wife in the backseat of his car. As the MP’s wait for the authorities to arrive, the impact and significance of the savage killing becomes apparent. Menkes’s co-writer and sister, Tinka, portrays a Marine captain, with most of the other roles played by actual Desert Storm veterans. A hallucinatory nightmare, THE BLOODY CHILD is a provocative meditation on the nature of violence.
