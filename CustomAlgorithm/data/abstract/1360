Jan Bocquoy writes the tale of his sexual life to age twenty-eight, picturing his creation (moms and dads drunk, the experience enduring ten seconds) and revealing his first ejaculation (at the hands of Eddy, in a beach-side train, as they view Laurel and Hardy), his relative knowledge with chicks, and his move from Harelbeck to Brussels. There he contact Greta, barman at a Bohemian cafe, who shows him the Kama Sutra, the naked Esther, who reads him stories, and Thérèse, his wife for 3 ages. They divide after two children; he goes to a small flat, writes porn material to pay the bills, works periodically on a novel, espouses anarchism, and matches more women. His self-confidence develops.
