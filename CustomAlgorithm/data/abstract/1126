The Old Man and the Sea is a 1958 film starring Spencer Tracy, in a portrayal for which he was nominated for a best actor Oscar. The screenplay (the "most literal, word-for-word rendition of a written story ever filmed") was adapted by Peter Viertel from the novella of the same name by Ernest Hemingway, and the film was directed by John Sturges. Sturges called it "technically the sloppiest picture I have ever made."Dimitri Tiomkin won the Academy Award for Best Original Score for his work on the film, one that was also nominated for best color cinematography.
