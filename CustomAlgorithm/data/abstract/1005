The Double Life of Véronique (French: La double vie de Véronique, Polish: Podwójne zycie Weroniki) is a 1991 French and Polish-language drama film directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski and starring Irène Jacob. Written by Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz, the film explores the themes of identity, love, and human intuition through the characters of Weronika, a Polish choir soprano, and her double, Véronique, a French music teacher. The two women do not know each other, and yet they share a mysterious and emotional bond that transcends language and geography. The film is notable for Slawomir Idziak's innovative cinematography and Zbigniew Preisner's haunting operatic score. The film was Kieslowski's first to be produced partly outside his native Poland. The Double Life of Véronique won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury and the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival for Krzysztof Kieslowski, and the Best Actress Award for Irène Jacob.
