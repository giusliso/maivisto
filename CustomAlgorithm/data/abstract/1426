Grace of My Heart is a 1996 film written and directed by Allison Anders, set in the pop music world, starting off in New York's Brill Building early 1960s era, weaving through the California Sound of the mid '60s and culminating with the adult-contemporary scene of the early 1970s. The plot follows the personal life and career trajectory of its protagonist, Denise Waverly. The soundtrack features a variety of songs by such artists as Burt Bacharach, Elvis Costello, Joni Mitchell, and Jill Sobule, which replicate the musical style that emerged from the Brill Building, New York's music factory during the heyday of girl groups and "pre-fab" acts like The Monkees.
