Cinderella is a 1950 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney and released by RKO Radio Pictures. Based on the fairy tale "Cendrillon" by Charles Perrault, it is twelfth in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, and was released on February 15, 1950. Directing credits go to Clyde Geronimi, Hamilton Luske and Wilfred Jackson. Songs were written by Mack David, Jerry Livingston, and Al Hoffman. Songs in the film include "A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes", "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo", "So This Is Love", "Sing Sweet Nightingale", "The Work Song", and "Cinderella".At the time, Walt Disney Productions had suffered from losing connections to the European film markets due the outbreak of World War II, suffering from embarrassing box office disasters like Pinocchio, Fantasia, and Bambi. The studio was over $4 million in debt and was on the verge of bankruptcy if one more slip-up were to occur. Walt Disney and his animators then turned back to feature film production in 1948 after producing a string of package films with the idea of adapting of Charles Perrault's Cendrillon. After two years in production with planning, collaboration, teamwork, and faith, Cinderella was finally released on February 15, 1950. It turned out to be the greatest critical and commercial smash hit for the studio since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and helped reverse fortunes for the studio for the better. It became one of the greatest and beloved Disney films ever made and one of the best American animated films ever made, selected by the American Film Institute. It received three Academy Award nominations, including Best Music, Original Song for "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo". In the years to come, it was followed by two direct-to-video sequels: Cinderella II: Dreams Come True and Cinderella III: A Twist in Time.
