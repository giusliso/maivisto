Cutthroat Island is a 1995 romantic comedy action adventure film directed by Renny Harlin. The film stars Geena Davis, Matthew Modine, and Frank Langella. The film, having endured a notoriously troubled and chaotic production involving multiple rewrites and recasts, received mixed reviews from critics and was a tremendous box office bomb. It was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the biggest box office flop of all time, though that record has subsequently been beaten by the likes of John Carter and Mars Needs Moms, both made by Disney. It was the last film Carolco Pictures produced before it went bankrupt.
