Young man Guan Jian comes to a city police station and says that his mother murdered his father in their native village ten years ago. When a police captain asks why it took so long to report the crime, Guan says that he simply didn't have enough evidence then, but now he can prove that his father died of poisoning. Finally, Guan's persistence makes the skeptical captain launch the investigation that may reveal the truth. This slow-moving but ultimately engrossing Chinese drama is not as much concerned with the question of whether the woman committed the crime as with the finely observed mother/son relationship that veers between love and hate. ~ Yuri German, Rovi
