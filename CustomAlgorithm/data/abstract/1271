North is a 1994 American adventure fantasy comedy-drama film directed by Rob Reiner and starring an ensemble cast including Elijah Wood, Jon Lovitz, Jason Alexander, Alan Arkin, Dan Aykroyd, Kathy Bates, Faith Ford, Graham Greene, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Reba McEntire, John Ritter, Abe Vigoda, with Bruce Willis in several roles and Scarlett Johansson in her film debut.The story is based on the novel North: The Tale of a 9-Year-Old Boy Who Becomes a Free Agent and Travels the World in Search of the Perfect Parents by Alan Zweibel, who wrote the screenplay and has a minor role in the film. Despite an all-star cast and director Reiner at the helm, North was both a critical and commercial failure, and was hated so thoroughly by critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert that both named it the worst film of 1994. It is often regarded as one of the worst films ever made[citation needed]. It was shot in Hawaii, Alaska, California, South Dakota, New Jersey, and New York.
