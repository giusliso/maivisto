Amadeus is a 1984 period drama film directed by Miloš Forman and written by Peter Shaffer.

The story is set in Vienna, Austria, during the latter half of the 18th century.The film was nominated for 53 awards and received 40, including eight Academy Awards (including Best Picture), four BAFTA Awards, four Golden Globes, and a Directors Guild of America (DGA) award. In 1998, the American Film Institute ranked Amadeus 53rd on its 100 Years... 100 Movies list.
