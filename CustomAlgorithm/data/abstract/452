Jaws 2 is a 1978 American horror thriller film and the first sequel to Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975), and the second installment in the Jaws franchise, which was based on Peter Benchley's novel of the same name. Directed by Jeannot Szwarc, it stars Roy Scheider as Police Chief Martin Brody, who must deal with another great white shark terrorizing the waters of Amity Island, a fictional seaside resort.Like the first film, the production of Jaws 2 was troubled. The original director, John D. Hancock, proved to be unsuitable for an action film and was replaced by Szwarc. Scheider, who only reprised his role to end a contractual issue with Universal, was also unhappy during production and had several heated exchanges with Szwarc.Jaws 2 remained on Variety's list of top ten box office hits of all time until the mid-1990s, and was the highest-grossing sequel in history until Rocky II the following year. The film's tagline, "Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...," has become one of the most famous in film history and has been parodied and homaged several times. It is widely regarded as being the best Jaws sequel.Jaws 2 was followed by Jaws 3-D and Jaws: The Revenge, released in 1983 and 1987, respectively.
