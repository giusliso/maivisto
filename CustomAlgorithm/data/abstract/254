This is also the only film appearance of Batgirl, who unexpectedly helps the title characters defeat the antagonists in the end, including Bane.Development for Batman & Robin began following the box office success of the previous film, Batman Forever. Warner Bros. commissioned the film for a June 1997 release. Schumacher and Goldsman conceived the film's plotline during pre-production on A Time to Kill. Principal photography began in September 1996 and finished in January 1997, two weeks ahead of the shooting schedule.Batman & Robin was released on June 20, 1997 to a number of negative reviews and is often regarded as one of the worst films ever made.

The song made for the film, "The End Is the Beginning Is the End" by The Smashing Pumpkins, won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 40th Grammy Awards.
