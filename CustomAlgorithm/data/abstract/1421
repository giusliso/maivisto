Mi Vida Loca (also known as My Crazy Life) is a 1994 American drama film directed and written by Allison Anders. It centers around the plight of young Mexicanas & Chicanas (and their male counterparts) growing up in the Echo Park section of Los Angeles, who face the struggles of friendship, romantic entanglements and motherhood in a neighborhood ravaged by gang violence. At the time of filming, most of the cast was made up of unknown actors, some of whom were actual gang members from the Echo Park neighborhood. It does, however, include the first film appearances from Salma Hayek and Jason Lee in small roles.
