The Crow is a 1994 American supernatural action film directed by Alex Proyas, written by David J. Schow and John Shirley, and starring Brandon Lee in his final film appearance. Based on James O'Barr's 1989 comic book of the same name, it tells the story of Eric Draven (Lee), a rock musician who is revived from the dead to avenge his murder and that of his fiancée.

The Crow was dedicated to Lee and his fiancée, Eliza.The film opened at the top of the box office and was a critical and commercial success. It also achieved a strong cult status.
