August is a 1996 film starring Anthony Hopkins as Ieuan (IPA:j/??/a/n) Davies, and featuring Rhys Ifans in a small role in one of his earliest films, as Griffiths. It is an adaptation of Chekhov's Uncle Vanya, with Ieuan taking over the title role. The film was Hopkins's first feature film with a full cast (he had previously directed the one-man-performance of Dylan Thomas: Return Journey in 1990); his next directorial effort would be Slipstream in 2007, which he also wrote and for which he also composed the score.
