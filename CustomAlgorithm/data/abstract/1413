Street Fighter is a 1994 American action film written and directed by Steven E. de Souza. It is based loosely on the Street Fighter video games produced by Capcom, and stars Jean-Claude Van Damme, and Raúl Juliá, along with supporting performances by Byron Mann, Damian Chapa, Kylie Minogue, Ming-Na and Wes Studi.The film altered the plot of the original game and motives of the Street Fighter characters. It also significantly lightened the tone of the adaptation, inserting several comical interludes (for instance, one particular fight scene between E. Honda and Zangief pays homage to the old Godzilla films).The film was a commercial success, making approximately three times its production costs, but was universally panned by both critics and fans of the video game series alike. However, Raúl Juliá's performance as General M. Bison was widely praised and garnered him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Saturn Awards. Julia, who at the time was suffering from stomach cancer (as evidenced by his pale and gaunt facial complexion throughout the movie), took the role at the request of his two children. This was Julia's final theatrical performance, and he died two months before the film's release. The film is dedicated to his memory.Two video game tie-ins based on the film were released which used digitized footage of the actors performing fight moves, similar to the presentations in Pit-Fighter and the Mortal Kombat series of games.
