Angels in the Outfield (known simply as Angels in some countries) is a 1994 remake of the 1951 film of the same name. The film stars Danny Glover, Tony Danza and Christopher Lloyd (the two latter actors have previously worked together on Taxi), and features appearances from future stars, including Adrien Brody, Matthew McConaughey, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Neal McDonough.Unlike the original, which focused on the Pittsburgh Pirates as the team in heavenly need, the 1994 remake focuses on the California Angels, who did not exist when the original film was released in 1951. The Walt Disney Company, which distributed the 1994 film, was a minority owner of the California Angels at the time. The film does, however, make a connection to the Pittsburgh team by having its world premiere at the Pirates home at the time, Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh. The film spawned two direct-to-video sequels, Angels in the Endzone and Angels in the Infield, neither as successful as the original.
