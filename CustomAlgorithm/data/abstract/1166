Love and Human Remains is a 1993 Canadian film directed by Denys Arcand and based on Brad Fraser's stage play Unidentified Human Remains and the True Nature of Love. Fraser also wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation. The film version follows the storyline of the original play fairly closely: a gay man and his heterosexual, female roommate try to find love and sexual gratification in Ottawa, as a serial killer is loose in the city.While the film was shot on location in Montreal, Quebec, the original stage play and the screenplay are both set in Edmonton, Alberta. There are attempts made in the dialogue, props and background film footage to identify the city as Edmonton, as in David's remark, "Let's order a Rosebowl pizza and discuss your sexual crises" (Rose Bowl Pizza is a well-known restaurant and bar in Edmonton). In another scene, the TV news reporter signs off from "CFR-" and gets cut off by the TV remote control before she can say "-N," the final call letter of Edmonton's CTV affiliate station. Sal's remark, "It's chicken night at Flash," is an allusion to Flashbacks, a long-gone Edmonton gay bar. There's also repeated use of a Sun newspaper (the Edmonton Sun is one of the city's major daily newspapers, although the city's name is not included in the masthead of the prop paper) and CBC-TV Canadian Football League footage of an Edmonton Eskimos game.Fraser won a Genie Award for his adapted screenplay, while stars Mia Kirshner, Joanne Vannicola, and Matthew Ferguson received acting nominations.It has not been released as a Region 1 DVD, although it is available in the UK on a Region 0 ("region-free") PAL DVD issued by Arrow Films.
