Vampire in Venice (Original title: Nosferatu a Venezia), also known as Nosferatu in Venice, is a 1988 Italian horror film directed by Augusto Caminito and starring Klaus Kinski, Christopher Plummer, Donald Pleasence and Barbara De Rossi.The film is an in-name-only sequel to Werner Herzog's Nosferatu the Vampyre, although its almost completely unrelated with Herzog's version of the Nosferatu story only with Kinski returning to reprise his loosely connected role. Donald Pleasence had previously played Dr. John Seward in Dracula, and Christopher Plummer later went on to play another vampire hunter, Abraham Van Helsing, in the film Dracula 2000. The film proved unsuccessful at the Italian box-office and enjoyed limited release abroad.
