A Streetcar Named Desire is a 1951 American film adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1947 play of the same name by Tennessee Williams. Williams collaborated with Oscar Saul on the screenplay and Elia Kazan, who directed the stage production, went on to direct the film. Marlon Brando, Kim Hunter, and Karl Malden, all members of the original Broadway cast, reprised their roles for the film. Vivien Leigh, who had appeared in the London theatre production, was brought in for the film version in lieu of Jessica Tandy, who had created the part of Blanche DuBois on Broadway. A Streetcar Named Desire holds the distinction of garnering Academy Award wins for actors in three out of the four acting categories. Oscars were won by Vivien Leigh, Best Actress, Karl Malden, Best Supporting Actor, and Kim Hunter, Best Supporting Actress. Marlon Brando was nominated for his performance as Stanley Kowalski but, although lauded for his powerful portrayal, did not win the Oscar for Best Actor. Brando's performance has since been cited as one of the most influential performances in the history of American cinema and has been widely credited for being one of the first performances to introduce Method acting to Hollywood moviegoers.The film is also noteworthy for being the first film to honor actors in both the Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress category. It has since been labeled by the American Film Institute as one of the greatest American movies of all time and subsequently selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" in 1999.
