Set behind-the-scenes on the Great White Way, this drama is an attempt to revive the dance film as it tells of how a womanizing, arrogant dancer gets his just desserts and learns the hard way to treat his partners with more respect. Nick has been a hoofer for many years and subconsciously knows the curtain is slowly closing on his career. Still he refuses to bow and exit gracefully. Meanwhile, at home, his lover Amy, a dancer turned physical therapist, is pressuring him to marry her, but Nick is afraid to commit and continues to see other women on the side. Thus the stage is set for his downfall and ultimately, his redemption. The story may be a chestnut, but the dance scenes are fine. They were choreographed by famed Broadway dance director Donald Byrd
