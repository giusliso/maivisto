It Takes Two is a 1995 film starring Kirstie Alley, Steve Guttenberg and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. The movie title was taken from the song "It Takes Two", song by Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston, which was featured in the closing credits. It Takes Two boasts some similarities to Walt Disney's The Parent Trap and Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper, which was pointed out in Leonard Maltin's review of the film.
