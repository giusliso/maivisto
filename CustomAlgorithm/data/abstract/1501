It also received rave critic reviews. The film is rated R for some violence and language.This film illustrates the conflicting views between traditional Chechen culture and Russian warfare through the skillful use of soundtrack, costuming and arms. The personal confrontation between two Russian soldiers and their Chechen captors is the main theme of the film, which was shot in the mountains of Dagestan (mostly in the aul of Ritcha, whose inhabitants are mentioned in the film's credits), a short distance away from the then-ongoing First Chechen War.
