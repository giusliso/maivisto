Shadow Conspiracy is a 1997 political thriller film starring Charlie Sheen, Donald Sutherland and Linda Hamilton. Sam Waterston, famous for his role as a district attorney in Law & Order, appears in the film as the president of the United States. It is the final film directed by George P. Cosmatos, who died of lung cancer in 2005. The film was poorly received by critics and was a box office bomb, and as of 2014, the film has never been released on either DVD or Blu-ray in the United States, though it did get a DVD release overseas.
