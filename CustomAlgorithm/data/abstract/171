Delicatessen is a 1991 French film, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro, starring Dominique Pinon and Karin Viard. It is set in an apartment building in a post-apocalyptic France of an ambiguous time period. The story focuses on the tenants of the building and their desperate bids to survive. Among these characters is the newly arrived Louison, who arrives to replace a tenant whose reason for departure is initially unclear. The butcher, Clapet, is the leader of the group who strives to keep control and balance in the apartment building.It is largely a character-based film, with much of the interest being gained from each tenant's own particular idiosyncrasies and their relationships to each other.Released in North America with the supertitle Terry Gilliam presents, the film—like its successor The City of Lost Children (1995)—is a deliberate homage to Gilliam.
