Kendall and Claire have a lot in common: they are both successful women writers, they are about the same age, and they were both lovers of David Berry. In addition to all that, they are close friends. They have gotten what they want out of their careers, but they would like to find a man to share their lives with. In their get-togethers, they share their insights into their current and previous dating experiences, and it is gradually becoming clear to both of them that either one would be happy if David Berry were to come back into her life; however, the rivalry and jealousy this understanding creates is not sufficient to destroy their friendship. ~ Clarke Fountain, Rovi
