Careful (1992) is the third feature film directed by Guy Maddin. It is Maddin's first colour film, shot on 16mm for a budget of $1.1 million. At one point, Martin Scorsese had agreed to act in the film, as Count Knotkers, but bowed out to complete Cape Fear. Maddin pursued casting hockey star Bobby Hull, but ended up casting Paul Cox.
