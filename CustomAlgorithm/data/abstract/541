Mortal Kombat is a 1995 American fantasy martial arts film written by Kevin Droney, directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, and starring Robin Shou, Linden Ashby, Bridgette Wilson, Christopher Lambert, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Talisa Soto. Based on the early Mortal Kombat fighting games, the film was the first part of the Mortal Kombat film series. Its plot follows the warrior Liu Kang, actor Johnny Cage, and Special Forces officer Sonya Blade, all three guided by the god Raiden, on their journey to combat the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung and his forces in a tournament to save Earth. The main inspiration for the film was the original title of the video game series, but it also features some elements and characters from the follow-up game Mortal Kombat II.Mortal Kombat, a co-production between Threshold Entertainment and Midway Games, was filmed primarily in Los Angeles, as well as on location in Thailand, and premiered on August 18, 1995 in the United States. Its tie-in media included hit soundtracks Mortal Kombat: Motion Picture Score and Mortal Kombat: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, and a prequel animated film The Journey Begins. Despite receiving mixed reviews by critics, the film proved very popular with fans of the games and spent three weeks as the number-one film at the U.S. box office, earning over $122 million worldwide. Due to its commercial success, the film later spawned a sequel, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, released in 1997, and a prequel television series, Mortal Kombat: Konquest, released in 1998. A reboot of the film was announced by New Line Cinema in 2011.
