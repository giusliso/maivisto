Sexual hang-ups as discussed during an all-night L.A. party provide the impetus for this lively film. The main character in this outing, which features snippets from the lives of several others, is Andie, a book editor celebrating the publication Michael's new, but rather bland self-help manual "Talking About Sex" with a large party. Andie gets into an argument with her dull boyfriend Doug. Carl is the publisher who wants to add more sparks to Michael's book. He also seeks to spark up his own flagging marriage. Rachel is non-orgasmic and has taking to "re-birthing" meditation to find a substitute. Also included at the party are a sexually frustrated fashion designer in her late thirties, and Andie's neighbor Lou who wants her to get together with his grandson who is not interested in Andie. ~ Sandra Brennan, Rovi
